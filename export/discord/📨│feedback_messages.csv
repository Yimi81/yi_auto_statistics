Nix,"I'm starting to test more creative abilities of Yi-Large and from just a bit of testing, it is already quite capable in terms of creative writing compared to some models I have tried. It feels like it actually has more of a writing 'soul' compared to GPT-4-0314, GPT-4-Turbo, and Gemini 1.5 Flash. For example I told each model to write a short horror story with a small general description and those three models gave more bland responses, or they took some details I said like 'horrific' and just made it a descriptor word in the story, while Yi-Large gave stories that felt much less bland and did not just take words I told it and use them as descriptor words; it actually included and followed what I wanted! Keep note this was over like 10 different prompts for creative writing and through all of them, Yi-Large showed it has quite a creative writing capacity from that limited testing! Going to experiment more with it later today in that domain, as well as other writing task ideas I can test it with, but I just wanted to give that bit of feedback as it had a lot of creative depth to it like when Claude 3 Opus & Sonnet first released back in February",2024-06-27 10:36:10.082000+00:00
Nix,"It was a pleasant surprise, but a very much welcome one. I hope with even more testing later today, it can show more of that in other diverse writing tasks!",2024-06-27 10:37:58.021000+00:00
Chen@01.ai,Nice work! It seems Yi-Large resonates with you most deeply.ðŸ˜†,2024-06-27 11:18:48.789000+00:00
Nix,"It does! For a lot of things the model works very well for me compared to other models outside of the complete cutting edge like Claude 3.5 Sonnet. I already have a few pages of notes about this model from how it responds, to instruction following, to coding, to its raw knowledge, and more. In about two weeks of mostly solely daily driving this model, I will compile everything together in a blog post for my research blog/personal blog and give my complete honest feedback of the model from the great, the good, and where the model struggles! 

I have found many examples already for many different things where the model is amazing at, and also where it might fail more often than other models, but I am saving it for the blog post as it will hold all of my findings, but just wanted to give this small feedback today since I was too excited to wait about sharing its depth in creative writing lol",2024-06-27 12:46:42.865000+00:00
