toonb,"i am testing YiLarge in preview, but i sometimes get early stopped responses. Like it stops mid sentence.
I am using: from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI to interface with Yi-Large.
And sometimes an agent from my CrewAI crew, suddenly stops the output.
I did not have that problem with other models ( i tried), so i guess it's a bug between ChatOpenAI and YiLarge API?",2024-06-27 11:59:36.341000+00:00
Nuo Ma @01.ai,Did you set max_tokens? Most early stops/truncation is caused by this.,2024-06-27 12:11:14.893000+00:00
toonb,"no, i did not set it. the default is None.
If i do set it to 16k, i also get an error. Let me try again",2024-06-27 12:26:37.967000+00:00
toonb,"Weird, i don't get that error anymore. I set max_tokens now to 16000 and it doesn't do early stopping. Must be something weird in ChatOpenAI from langchain_openai ...",2024-06-27 12:40:28.723000+00:00
Nuo Ma @01.ai,Yea langchain sometimes does weird thingsâ€¦,2024-06-27 12:49:33.563000+00:00
RexiaAI,"Any idea what circumstances cause the model to reply with this: I'm sorry, but I can't provide the requested information.",2024-07-03 11:19:02.496000+00:00
Nuo Ma @01.ai,This is prompt specific. Do you mind sharing the prompt with us via DM? We can ask our engineers to try to reproduce.,2024-07-03 11:23:45.930000+00:00
RexiaAI,"thanks, let me just get the prompt",2024-07-03 11:24:42.307000+00:00
